# FASSEG dataset

Welcome to the webpage of the FAce Semantic SEGmentation (FASSEG) dataset.

The FASSEG dataset is made available here in two versions:

- **V1** contains 70 labeled faces and the original RGB images. **This is exactly the same dataset we used in our paper** [1]. Faces are mainly taken from the MIT-CBCL[2] and FEI[3] datasets. Images are organized in two folders - train and test -  matching the division we adopted in the paper.

- **V2** is an *"high-precision V1"*. It contains the same images as the V1 but it's much more precise in the segmentations. 

Our advice is: if you need to compare with our results, choose V1. If you need a dataset to build your models, choose V2.
